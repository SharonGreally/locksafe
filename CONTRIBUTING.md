# Contributor's Guide


### Getting Started

1.  If you are new to Git and GitHub, it is advisable that you go through
    [GitHub For Beginners](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/)
    **before** moving to Step 2.

2.  Fork the project on GitHub.
    [Help Guide to Fork a Repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo/).

3.  Clone the project.
    [Help Guide to Clone a Repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)

4.  Create a branch specific to the issue you are working on.

    ```shell
    git checkout -b update-readme-file
    ```

    For clarity, name
    your branch `update-xxx` or `fix-xxx`. The `xxx` is a short
    description of the changes you're making. Examples include `update-readme` or
    `fix-typo-on-contribution-md`.

5.  Open up the project in android studio, select the file you want
    to contribute to, and make your changes.

    If you are making changes to the `README.md` file, you would need to have
    Markdown knowledge. Visit
    [here to read about GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
    and
    [here to practice](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

    *   If you are adding a new project/organisation to the README, make sure
        it's listed in alphabetical order.
    *   If you are adding a new organisation, make sure you add an organisation
        label to the organisation name. This would help distinguish projects
        from organisation projects.

6.  Add your modified
    files to git, [How to Add, Commit, Push, and Go](http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2/).

    ```shell
    git add path/to/filename.ext
    ```

    You can also add all unstaged files using:

    ```shell
    git add .
    ```

    **Note:** using a `git add .` will automatically add all files. You can do a
    `git status` to see your changes, but do it **before** `git add`.

6.  Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

    ```shell
    git commit -m "Brief Description of Commit"
    ```

7.  Push your commits to your GitHub Fork:

    ```shell
    git push -u origin branch-name
    ```

8.  Submit a pull request.

    Within GitHub, visit this main repository and you should see a banner
    suggesting to make a pull request. While you're writing up the pull
    request, you can add `Closes #XXX` in the message body where `#XXX` is the
    issue you're fixing. So an example would be `Closes #42` would close issue
    `#42`.

### Submitting a Pull Request

[What is a Pull Request?](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/)

If you decide to fix an issue, it's advisable to check the comment thread to see if there's somebody already working on a fix. If no one is working on it, kindly leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it. That way
other people don't accidentally duplicate your effort.

In a situation whereby somebody decides to fix an issue but doesn't follow up
for a particular period of time, say 2-3 weeks, it's acceptable to still pick
up the issue but make sure to leave a comment.
